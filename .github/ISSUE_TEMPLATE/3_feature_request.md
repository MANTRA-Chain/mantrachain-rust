## Use case

<!--
     Please tell us the challenge you are running into that led to you wanting
     a new feature.

     Did you find a market gap that mantrachain-rust can close?

     Is your feature request related to a problem? Please give a clear and
     concise description of what the problem is.

     Describe the alternative solutions you've considered.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
     Briefly but precisely describe what you would like mantrachain-rust to be able to do.

     Consider attaching something showing what you are imagining:
      * images
      * videos
      * code samples

     Does this have to be provided by mantrachain-rust directly, or can it be provided
     by a third-party contract? If so, maybe consider implementing and
     share it with the community rather than filing a bug.
