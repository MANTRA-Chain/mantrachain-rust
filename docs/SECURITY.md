## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is something we take seriously at MANTRA. Thanks for taking the time to improve the security of `mantra-dex`,
we appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security bugs by sending an email to security@mantrachain.io. Do not report it publicly on the GitHub
issues tracker. Your report should detail the necessary steps to reproduce the security issue. We will acknowledge your
email within 72 hours and send a detailed response indicating the next steps. After the initial reply to your report,
we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information
or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

If we receive a security bug report, we assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potentially similar problems.
- Rollout the fixes.
